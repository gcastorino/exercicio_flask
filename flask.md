Take me where
I guess markdown behaves quite similar to html. I will attach an example below;

[Take me there](#there_you_go)
[Take me where](#here)

I defined two links with anchor names

below is the first anchor

<a name="there_you_go"></a>Take me there

here is the second anchor

<a name="here"></a>Take me where

here is it in practice

Take me there will take you down
Take me where will take you up
/
Take me there
/
blank space for test
/
/
/
/
/
/
blank space end
/
/

So it does work. Hope this helps
